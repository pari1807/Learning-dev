 ✨ What is MERN?
MERN is a powerful JavaScript stack used for building modern web applications. It consists of four key technologies:

📊 MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing data.
🚀 Express.js: A backend framework for building APIs.
⚛️ React: A frontend library for building user interfaces.
🖥️ Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.

This roadmap will guide you through learning each of these technologies in a structured and beginner-friendly way. 🛠️
